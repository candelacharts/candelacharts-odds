# Strategy Selection
# Choose trading strategy: arbitrage or technical
# 
# arbitrage: Only trades on risk-free arbitrage opportunities (YES + NO < $1.00)
#            Safe, guaranteed profit, but opportunities are rare
# 
# technical: Trades based on technical analysis indicators (RSI, MACD, VWAP, etc.)
#            More frequent trades, but involves directional risk
# 
# Default: arbitrage (recommended for safety)
STRATEGY=technical

# Trading Configuration
# Auto-close profit target in USD (default: 20)
# When either YES or NO side reaches this profit, BOTH sides are closed
# Examples: 10, 20, 50, 100
PROFIT_TARGET_USD=20

# Maximum number of positions per candle period (strategy-specific)
# For 15-min markets: limits positions per 15-minute period
# For hourly markets: limits positions per 1-hour period

# Arbitrage strategy: Maximum positions per candle (default: 3)
# Arbitrage is low-risk, so multiple positions are allowed
# Examples: 1, 3, 5, 10
MAX_ARBITRAGE_POSITIONS=3

# Technical strategy: Maximum positions per candle (default: 1)
# Technical trading is higher-risk, so fewer positions recommended
# Examples: 1, 2, 3
MAX_TECHNICAL_POSITIONS=1

# Auto-clear stale positions after X minutes (default: 15)
# Positions older than this will be automatically removed from tracking
# This helps clean up expired markets and stale position data
# Examples: 15, 30, 60
AUTO_CLEAR_MINUTES=15

# Strike cross gap threshold (percentage)
# Price must cross strike by this percentage to trigger a trade signal
# Lower values = more sensitive (more trades, potentially more false signals)
# Higher values = less sensitive (fewer trades, stronger confirmation)
# Default: 0.015 (0.015%)
# Examples: 0.010 (0.010%), 0.015 (0.015%), 0.020 (0.020%), 0.050 (0.050%)
STRIKE_GAP_PERCENT=0.015

# Standard Deviation Levels for Volatility-Based Exits
# These define thresholds for taking profit based on price movement magnitude
# Higher values = wait for larger moves before exiting (more profit potential, more risk)
# Lower values = exit on smaller moves (less profit potential, less risk)

# 1 Standard Deviation (~68% of moves) - Quick exits on common moves
# Default: 0.050 (0.050% = $50 on $100k)
STDEV_1_PERCENT=0.050

# 2 Standard Deviations (~95% of moves) - Moderate moves
# Default: 0.100 (0.100% = $100 on $100k)
STDEV_2_PERCENT=0.100

# 3 Standard Deviations (~99.7% of moves) - Large moves
# Default: 0.150 (0.150% = $150 on $100k)
STDEV_3_PERCENT=0.150

# 4 Standard Deviations (~99.99% of moves) - Extreme rare moves
# Default: 0.200 (0.200% = $200 on $100k)
STDEV_4_PERCENT=0.200

# Maximum Order Retry Attempts
# How many times to retry a failed order before giving up (per candle)
# Higher values = more persistent (more API calls, higher chance of success)
# Lower values = give up faster (fewer API calls, less spam)
# Default: 5
# Examples: 1 (no retries), 3 (moderate), 5 (default), 10 (aggressive)
MAX_ORDER_RETRIES=5

# Minimum Time to Expiry (minutes)
# Orders will not be placed if less than this time remains until market close
# Kalshi rejects orders too close to expiry
# Default: 5
# Examples: 3 (very aggressive), 5 (default), 10 (conservative)
MIN_TIME_TO_EXPIRY_MIN=2
